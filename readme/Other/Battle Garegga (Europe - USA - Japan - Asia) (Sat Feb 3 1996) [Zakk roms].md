        [Details]

            -Mahou guest characters unlocked.
            -ABC ship type selectable via start button
            -Selectable autofire rate: Start+B raises autofire rate (8hz, 10hz, 12hz, 15hz, 20hz, 30hz). You cannot decrease the autofire rate.
            -No rank carry over between credits. Rank starts at power on default every credit.
            -Item drop order reset to initial value every credit
            -Item non collected counts reset to initial values every credit
            -Quick reset: start+ABC resets to the copyright screen
            -Scoreboard display bug fixed. Top scores will show the proper letter instead of punctuation for 10M+
            -Autofire rate display. Bottom left and right display current autofire rate for respective player.
            -Rank display. Real time display of current game rank.
            -Rank change display: Per-frame display of rank change during the frame. This excludes per-frame rank adjustments and any rank changes due to shooting (normal and option).
            -Rank percentage display. Should line up with the rank percentage in the M2 port.
            -Per frame rank display.
            -Rank and rank change are shown in hexadecimal. Per frame is shown in decimal. This is because the M2 port shows the per-frame rank in decimal too; I wanted them to match up for less (personal) confusion.
